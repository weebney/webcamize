# Contributing

This project follows a unique philosophy centered around user experience: if the project isn't assisting you, you're experiencing difficulties, the documentation is unclear, or there are bugs, then those are considered as issues. We believe that we can work collaboratively to address these issues and enhance the overall experience.

If you come across any issues, face any problems, or have suggestions for improvement, please do not hesitate to open an issue in our issue tracker. We welcome everyone, including beginners, to contribute to the project.
